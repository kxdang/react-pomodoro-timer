## 👨‍🎓What I learned:

- Practicing building applications with React Hooks, including useState and useEffect
- Practicing fetching API's in useEffect Hook and displaying data on the DOM
- Learned how to create a countdown using setInterval
- Explored [Emotion styled components](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) and used Global Styles to create a dark mode theme
